# Add indicator for reduced Household CSI Score(rcsi)

Add indicator for reduced Household CSI Score(rcsi)

## Usage

``` r
add_rcsi(
  .dataset,
  fsl_rcsi_lessquality = "fsl_rcsi_lessquality",
  fsl_rcsi_borrow = "fsl_rcsi_borrow",
  fsl_rcsi_mealsize = "fsl_rcsi_mealsize",
  fsl_rcsi_mealadult = "fsl_rcsi_mealadult",
  fsl_rcsi_mealnb = "fsl_rcsi_mealnb"
)
```

## Arguments

- .dataset:

  Main Dataset

- fsl_rcsi_lessquality:

  Column representing question- During the last 7 days, were there days
  (and, if so, how many) when your household had to rely on less
  preferred and less expensive food to cope with a lack of food or money
  to buy it?

- fsl_rcsi_borrow:

  Column representing question- During the last 7 days, were there days
  (and, if so, how many) when your household had to borrow food or rely
  on help from a relative or friend to cope with a lack of food or money
  to buy it?

- fsl_rcsi_mealsize:

  Column representing question- During the last 7 days, were there days
  (and, if so, how many) when your household had to limit portion size
  of meals at meal times to cope with a lack of food or money to buy it?

- fsl_rcsi_mealadult:

  Column representing question- During the last 7 days, were there days
  (and, if so, how many) when your household had to restrict consumption
  by adults in order for small children to eat to cope with a lack of
  food or money to buy it?

- fsl_rcsi_mealnb:

  Column representing question - During the last 7 days, were there days
  (and, if so, how many) when your household had to reduce number of
  meals eaten in a day to cope with a lack of food or money to buy it?

## Value

A dataset with one additional column.

``` r

  fsl_rcsi_mealadult = c(4, 3, 5, 0),
  fsl_rcsi_mealnb = c(2, 5, NA_integer_, 1)
)
